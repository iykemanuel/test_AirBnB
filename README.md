## Description

This team project is part of the [ALX-Holberton](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full-Stack Software Engineering program. It's the first step towards building our first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data base management and the base classes for the storage of this data. It an important phase of the project(s) as this would be the basis for the entire AirBnB clone.

## Installation
Clone this repository using the command below

    git clone https://github.com/Reganmatics/AirBnB_clone.git
 After cloning the repository navigate to the "AirBnB" repository using the command below

Our console works in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, like a Unix shell. It prints the prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.
